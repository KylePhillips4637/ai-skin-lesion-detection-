# AI-Skin-Lesion-Detection

## Overview
AI Skin Lesion Detection is a tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing skin lesions through artificial intelligence and machine learning. This project uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images of skin lesions and predict potential diagnoses, thus aiding in early detection and treatment planning. The algorithms have been trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) as part of their annual challenge, ensuring the system is built on robust and diverse data.

## Project Achievements
- **Task 1:** Automated identification of lesion segmentation boundaries from dermoscopic images.

- **Task 2:** Classification of skin lesions into melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis.

- **Task 3:** Development of a Streamlit-based web interface for image upload and analysis.
