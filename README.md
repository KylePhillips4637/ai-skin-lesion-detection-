# AI-Skin-Lesion-Detection

## Overview
AI Skin Lesion Detection is a tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing skin lesions through artificial intelligence and machine learning. This project uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images of skin lesions and predict potential diagnoses, thus aiding in early detection and treatment planning. The algorithms have been trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) as part of their annual challenge, ensuring the system is built on robust and diverse data.

## Project Achievements
- **Task 1:** Automated identification of lesion segmentation boundaries from dermoscopic images.

- **Task 2:** Classification of skin lesions into melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis.

- **Task 3:** Development of a Streamlit-based web interface for image upload and analysis.

## Disclaimer
The AI Skin Lesion Detection tool is intended for educational and research purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, or diagnosis. While this tool aims to provide helpful insights and augment healthcare professionals' capabilities in skin lesion analysis, it should not be used as the sole basis for any medical decisions or diagnoses.

The accuracy of the AI Skin Lesion Detection tool's output depends on various factors, including the quality of the input images and the current state of the underlying models, which are based on data available up to a certain point in time. As with any AI-based tool, there is always a possibility of errors, and users should be cautious in their interpretation of the results.
